## 🧠 Understanding Vehicle Dynamics

Vehicle dynamics is the study of how forces and moments affect vehicle motion. This simulator models the complex interactions between:

- **Powertrain**: Motor torques transmitted through gear ratios to drive wheels
- **Steering Systems**: Front and rear wheel steering for enhanced maneuverability  
- **Suspension**: Spring-damper systems affecting ride comfort and handling
- **Payload Effects**: How cargo weight and position influence vehicle behavior
- **Control Systems**: PID feedback loops maintaining desired speed and heading

This hands-on approach helps understand why Formula 1 cars handle differently than SUVs, how all-wheel drive systems work, what makes electric vehicles unique, and how RC racing cars achieve their incredible performance.
