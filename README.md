## 🧠 Understanding Vehicle Dynamics

Vehicle dynamics is the study of how forces and moments affect vehicle motion. This simulator models the complex interactions between:

- **Powertrain**: Motor torques transmitted through gear ratios to drive wheels
- **Steering Systems**: Front and rear wheel steering for enhanced maneuverability

### 🔧 Motor Configuration Guide

#### **Max Torque (Nm)**

- Typical ranges: 150-600 Nm depending on vehicle type

#### **Efficiency (%)**
- Motor efficiency affecting power delivery to wheels
- Electric motors: 90-98%, ICE: 25-35%
- Higher efficiency = more torque reaches the wheels

#### **Gear Ratio**
- Transmission ratio from motor to wheels
- Lower ratios = higher top speed, slower acceleration
- Higher ratios = faster acceleration, lower top speed

#### **Front/Rear Split (%)**
- Torque distribution between front and rear axles
- 30% = rear-wheel drive character
- 50% = balanced all-wheel drive
- 80% = front-wheel drive character

#### **Response Time (s)**
